      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</p>
<p>To involve other mindsets in this discussion, my friend and I founded a society named Future Technology and Design (FT+D). Our aim was to encourage other multi-discipline discussion around architecture and the development of our Built Environment.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we put on a series of lectures and presentations, inviting disciplines from product designers to robotics engineers, politics and sociology students to game developers, and actively built a society.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, alongside the various lectures and guest speakers we hosted, we completed one major project building a 3D scanner from scratch. The subject was based on the interest of the society and included designing and making circuit boards, 3D printing components and learning the software to manipulate point clouds/meshes taken from the scans. We then used this scanner to attempt to scan environments and objects into the computer.</p>
<p>The society was left as one of the fastest growing societies at the university when we completed our degrees, and formed the founding ideas of my first business out of university.</p>
