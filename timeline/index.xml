My duty included all managerial roles in running a successful shop, alongside repairing and building Windows and Mac PCs/laptops and mobiles. I engage with clients on the telephone and in store to resolve computer related problems. Since starting in April 2016, I have cleaned, organised and streamlined the workshop established modern, agile working practices which have significantly helped with work flow and profitability. I looked after spend, stock, financial recording and managine suppliers and customers. I also completely overhauled the Computer Right website, and social media accounts. During the 7 months I was employed, turnover increased over 50% from the months previous to my employment and Computer Right received a 200% increase on 4 and 5 star Google reviews, compared to the previous 4 years.</p>
<p>I soon wrote a business plan to expand on Computer Right and bought the business as an asset from the previous company.</p>

            <description>BIMscript Ltd My first company, BIMscript Ltd was a technology and BIM consultancy for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries.
I took the successes of the society I ran at university and moved it into the professional world. BIMscript provided expert advice and implementation on emerging technologies including virtual reality, 3D printing, 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry and modelling, BIM implementation and strategy, and cloud technologies.
Our clients included major construction and engineering firms VolkerFitzpatrick and Hoare Lea, among other clients such as FreestyleXtreme Ltd and the Foundation for the Common Good.</description>

<p>During my time as CTO for BIMscript, we completed a proof of concept for a large scale web platform to revolutionise the method of project delivery for our major client, VolkerFitzpatrick. This proof of concept not only won funding, but was highly received by the client and many other significant actors in the construction tech world.</p>
<p>The project, named the BIMportal, was a multi-device cloud based suite of applications which enabled all stakeholders in a construction project to engage with it in real time. We had to restructure the company in order to fulfil the requirements for funding and so we closed BIMscript Ltd and opened a new company, putting our time into developing the BIMportal further.</p>

            <description>Future Technology and Design Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</description>

<p>Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</p>
<p>To involve other mindsets in this discussion, my friend and I founded a society named Future Technology and Design (FT+D). Our aim was to encourage other multi-discipline discussion around architecture and the development of our Built Environment.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we put on a series of lectures and presentations, inviting disciplines from product designers to robotics engineers, politics and sociology students to game developers, and actively built a society.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, alongside the various lectures and guest speakers we hosted, we completed one major project building a 3D scanner from scratch. The subject was based on the interest of the society and included designing and making circuit boards, 3D printing components and learning the software to manipulate point clouds/meshes taken from the scans. We then used this scanner to attempt to scan environments and objects into the computer.</p>
<p>The society was left as one of the fastest growing societies at the university when we completed our degrees, and formed the founding ideas of my first business out of university.</p>
