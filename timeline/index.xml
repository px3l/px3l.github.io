            <description>BIMLauncher Ltd I am the product manager for BIMLauncher Ltd.
The product is a cloud based set of integrations between software vendors APIs that allowed data to be moved from one vendor to another, essentially the ability to synchronise or migrate data between different cloud software. This was managed through a centralised hub, hosted online.
I came in at an early stage, where an initial integration had been completed and a new, more complex one had to be developed.</description>

<p>I am the product manager for BIMLauncher Ltd.</p>
<p>The product is a cloud based set of integrations between software vendors APIs that allowed data to be moved from one vendor to another, essentially the ability to synchronise or migrate data between different cloud software. This was managed through a centralised hub, hosted online.</p>
<p>I came in at an early stage, where an initial integration had been completed and a new, more complex one had to be developed. I played an essential role in utilising various online methods of collaboration to successfully build and deliver this new integration for the client.</p>
<p>We had a team working remotely all over the world: our senior developer in Indonesia, the CEO in Ireland, I was in England and others in Canada, Philippines and Lebanon. Because of the time differences, we had to plan the few meetings we could have together via video chat and so we relied on using software which everyone could input to in their own working time.</p>
<p>I had to keep everyone on the same page, by ensuring our shared information was correct and easy for each other to understand by themselves. Alongside this, I had to help develop the integration from conceptual design to technical specifications which could be relayed to the team. The integration was delivered successfully and immediately went live on 16 projects.</p>
<p>Since then, my focus has been on a marketing strategy along with UX and site design.</p>

            <description>Computer Right Needing a temporary job for a few months, I was employed as a manager, engineer and sales representative at Computer Right, a computer shop in Bristol registered under Bristol Office Essentials Ltd. My duties included all managerial roles in running a successful shop, alongside repairing and building Windows and Mac PCs/laptops and mobiles.
When I joined the shop, they had dwindling business and a mediocre reputation locally. I used my experience of being in startup companies to help turn the business around and established modern, agile working practices which have significantly helped with work flow and profitability.</description>

<p>Needing a temporary job for a few months, I was employed as a manager, engineer and sales representative at Computer Right, a computer shop in Bristol registered under Bristol Office Essentials Ltd. My duties included all managerial roles in running a successful shop, alongside repairing and building Windows and Mac PCs/laptops and mobiles.</p>
<p>When I joined the shop, they had dwindling business and a mediocre reputation locally. I used my experience of being in startup companies to help turn the business around and established modern, agile working practices which have significantly helped with work flow and profitability. Turnover increased over 50% from the months previous to my employment and Computer Right received a 200% increase on 5 star Google reviews, compared to the previous 4 years.</p>
<h2 id="strange-labs">Strange Labs</h2>
<p>I made a decision to build on the new successes and try a new idea I had: a place for tech enthusiasts to meet and build their own projects.</p>
<p>I negotiated the sale of Computer Right off my employer and turned it into Strange Labs. This was the first technology Meet up space of it&rsquo;s kind in the UK on the high street. Alongside this, Strange Labs quickly became the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=T2iLXvuVHYqLlwS9varoAg&amp;q=strange+labs&amp;oq=strange+labs&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoFCAAQgwE6BAgAEAM6BAgAEApKJQgXEiEwZzEwM2c3Nmc4OWc4MWc5MGc2N2c4MWcxMDlnOTVnNzdKGQgYEhUwZzFnMWcxZzFnMWcxZzFnMWcxZzNQpAxY9BZguhhoAHAAeACAAVqIAa8GkgECMTKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-ZqDq9ToAhWKxYUKHb2eCi0Q4dUDCAg&amp;uact=5#lrd=0x48718e0bd868ffff:0xa1142d8202740a2a,1,,,">top rated computer shop in Bristol</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://strangelabs.io/images/blog/designing-a-space-for-technology-enthusiasts-6.jpg" alt="Strange Labs">
You can see my notes on designing the physical space <a href="https://strangelabs.io/blog/designing-a-space-for-technology-enthusiasts/">here</a>, on the Strange Labs blog</p>
<p>Though the main business was on PC custom builds, repairs and upgrades, I hosted successful long running meetup series on topics from AI, crypto-currency, and emerging technology in politics. Several of the projects started in Strange Labs have continued to develop - most notably a virtual reality art gallery where the works can be bought by crypto-currencies, and a raffle based on random selections on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Sadly, the shop was closed due to the 2020 COVID pandemic and I moved to an online only business with a narrower focus, offering bespoke custom build computers for professionals and high end gaming.</p>

            <description>Jenca Ltd Building on the idea of an open platform for building data, Jenca was an attempt to help democratize the building process by allowing non-technical workers found in the AEC industries to engage with open technologies.
The premise was a platform which allowed users to run compile applications at scale. These applications were deployed as collections, which we called Projects.
The platform was based on a NodeJS architecture running on Docker and Kubernetes.</description>

<p>Jenca has been featured in <a href="http://www.bimplus.co.uk/news/google-ins4pires-n7ew-bim-app-platform-j7enca/" target="blank">BIM+ magazine</a> and partnered with other cutting edge AEC web applications like the <a href="http://bimserver.org/" target="blank">BIMserver</a>, <a href="http://3drepo.org/" target="blank">3D Repo</a> and <a href="http://duraark.eu/" target="blank">Duraark</a>.</p></p>
<p>We secured funding through a business accelerator in London, however the project required a significant R&amp;D stage in order to explore how these applications would work together and the investors were not willing to engage further.</p>

            <description>BIMscript Ltd My first company, BIMscript Ltd was a technology and BIM consultancy for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries.
I took the successes of the society I ran at university and moved it into the professional world. BIMscript provided expert advice and implementation on emerging technologies including virtual reality, 3D printing, 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry and modelling, BIM implementation and strategy, and cloud technologies.
Our clients included major construction and engineering firms VolkerFitzpatrick and Hoare Lea, among other clients such as FreestyleXtreme Ltd and the Foundation for the Common Good.</description>

<p>My first company, BIMscript Ltd was a technology and BIM consultancy for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries.</p>
<p>I took the successes of the <a href="/timeline/ftd/">society</a> I ran at university and moved it into the professional world. BIMscript provided expert advice and implementation on emerging technologies including virtual reality, 3D printing, 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry and modelling, BIM implementation and strategy, and cloud technologies.</p>
<p>Our clients included major construction and engineering firms <a href="http://www.volkerfitzpatrick.co.uk/">VolkerFitzpatrick</a> and <a href="http://www.hoarelea.com/">Hoare Lea</a>, among other clients such as <a href="http://www.freestylextreme.com/">FreestyleXtreme Ltd</a> and the Foundation for the Common Good.</p>
<p>During my time as CTO for BIMscript, we completed a proof of concept for a large scale web platform to revolutionise the method of project delivery for our major client, VolkerFitzpatrick. This proof of concept not only won funding, but was highly received by the client and many other significant actors in the construction tech world.</p>
<p>The project, named the BIMportal, was a multi-device cloud based suite of applications which enabled all stakeholders in a construction project to engage with it in real time. We had to restructure the company in order to fulfil the requirements for funding and so we closed BIMscript Ltd and opened a new company, putting our time into developing the BIMportal further.</p>

            <description>Future Technology and Design Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</description>

<p>Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</p>
<p>To involve other mindsets in this discussion, my friend and I founded a society named Future Technology and Design (FT+D). Our aim was to encourage other multi-discipline discussion around architecture and the development of our Built Environment.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we put on a series of lectures and presentations, inviting disciplines from product designers to robotics engineers, politics and sociology students to game developers, and actively built a society.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, alongside the various lectures and guest speakers we hosted, we completed one major project building a 3D scanner from scratch. The subject was based on the interest of the society and included designing and making circuit boards, 3D printing components and learning the software to manipulate point clouds/meshes taken from the scans. We then used this scanner to attempt to scan environments and objects into the computer.</p>
<p>The society was left as one of the fastest growing societies at the university when we completed our degrees, and formed the founding ideas of my first business out of university.</p>
