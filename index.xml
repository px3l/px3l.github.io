      <description>BIMLauncher Ltd develops and runs integrations between cloud software. The platform offers highly configurable and customisable workflows to be built between software for construction projects which enable data synchronization and migrations.
From the digitilastion of the AEC industries emerged a new and important concept: the Common Data Environment (CDE). Many project management solutions were developed each offering a set of tools and claiming to act as the CDE but the reality is that across a large construction project, teams of different disciplines, geographic locations and even different stages of the project lifecycle, choose their own digital tools.</description>

      <description>Taking my favourite experiences from the technology startup world: meeting enthusiastic people and sharing ideas, I created an environment where that could happen regularly.
Strange Labs was the first technology Meet up space of it&amp;rsquo;s kind in the UK on the high street. Alongside this, Strange Labs quickly became the top rated computer shop in Bristol.
Though the main business was through PC custom builds, repairs and upgrades, this simply funded the core idea: a space to facilitate technology discussion and discovery.</description>

      <description>Building on the idea of an open platform for building data, Jenca was an attempt to help democratize the building process by allowing non-technical workers found in the AEC industries to engage with open technologies.
The premise was a platform which allowed users to run compile applications at scale. These applications were deployed as collections, which we called Projects.
The platform was based on a NodeJS architecture running on Docker and Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</description>
