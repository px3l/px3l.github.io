      <description>BIMLauncher Ltd BIMLauncher ltd develops and runs a cloud based set of integrations between software vendors APIs that allowed data to be moved from one vendor to another, essentially the ability to synchronise or migrate data between different cloud software. This is managed through a centralised hub, hosted online.
I came in at an early stage, where an initial integration had been completed and a new, more complex one had to be developed.</description>

      <description>Strange Labs I wanted to take my favourite experiences from the technology startup world: meeting enthusiastic people and sharing ideas, and create an environment where that could happen regularly.
Strange Labs was the first technology Meet up space of it&amp;rsquo;s kind in the UK on the high street. Alongside this, Strange Labs quickly became the top rated computer shop in Bristol.
Though the main business was through PC custom builds, repairs and upgrades, the core idea of the space was facilitating technology discussion and discovery.</description>

      <description>Jenca Ltd Building on the idea of an open platform for building data, Jenca was an attempt to help democratize the building process by allowing non-technical workers found in the AEC industries to engage with open technologies.
The premise was a platform which allowed users to run compile applications at scale. These applications were deployed as collections, which we called Projects.
The platform was based on a NodeJS architecture running on Docker and Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Future Technology and Design Whilst studying in the final year of my degree, a classmate and I observed that there was very minimal, if any, interaction between disciplines at university. We were studying Architecture and planning, yet we were not once advised to seek any other input to the subject than from the lecturers, classmates and industry professionals. We both thought, given the ongoing digitalisation of construction, and the future cities initiatives, that students and lecturers involved in other technical fields may have vital input into how Architecture can be done better.</description>
