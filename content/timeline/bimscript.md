## BIMscript Ltd

BIMscript</a> was a technology and BIM consultancy for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries. We provided expert advice and implementation on cutting edge technologies including virtual reality, 3d printing, 3d scanning and modelling, BIM implementation and strategy and web technologies. Our clients included major construction and engineering firms <a href="http://www.volkerfitzpatrick.co.uk/" target="blank">VolkerFitzpatrick</a> and <a href="http://www.hoarelea.com/" target="blank">Hoare Lea</a>, and other clients such as <a href="http://www.freestylextreme.com/" target="blank">FreestyleXtreme Ltd</a> and the Foundation for the Common Good.

During the time as CTO for BIMscript, we completed a proof of concept for a large scale web platform to revolutionise the method of project delivery of our major client, VolkerFitzpatrick. This project not only won funding, but was highly received by the client and many other significant actors in the construction tech world. The project, named the BIMportal, is a multi-device web based suite of applications which enabled all stakeholders in a project to engage with it in real time.
