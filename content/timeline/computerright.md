## Computer Right Ltd

I was employed as a manager, computer expert, sales representative and engineer at Computer Right, a computer shop in Bristol registered under Bristol Office Essentials Ltd. My duty included all managerial roles in running a successful shop, alongside repairing and building Windows and Mac PCs/laptops and mobiles. I engage with clients on the telephone and in store to resolve computer related problems. Since starting in April 2016, I have cleaned, organised and streamlined the workshop established modern, agile working practices which have significantly helped with work flow and profitability. I looked after spend, stock, financial recording and managine suppliers and customers. I also completely overhauled the Computer Right website, and social media accounts. During the 7 months I was employed, turnover increased over 50% from the months previous to my employment and Computer Right received a 200% increase on 4 and 5 star Google reviews, compared to the previous 4 years.

I soon wrote a business plan to expand on Computer Right and bought the business as an asset from the previous company.
