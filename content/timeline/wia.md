## World Information Architecture UX Conference 2015

I was invited to speak at the <a href="http://2015.worldiaday.org/" target="blank">World Information Architecture</a> UX Conference in Bristol. I presented how to design web applications for people in the construction industry, specifically how to design an application which can be used by labourers on site and in the office.
