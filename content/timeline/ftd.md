## Future Technology and Design

FT+D was a society founded whilst studying Architecture and Planning as a method to encourage multi-discipline discussion around architecture. We completed one major project to build a 3D scanner from scratch. This included designing and making circuit boards, 3D printing components and learning the software to manipulate point clouds/meshes taken from the scans.
