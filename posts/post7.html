<p class="tldr">TL;DR: Google's Deep Dream shows us how simple pattern play in visuals with some iterative dynamic can create experiences which previously felt exclusively human and deeply conscious. This reinforces our mind as a complex network of networks</p>

<p> I think I am late to the party here, but better late than never! I read the recently released white paper by Google: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08734.pdf" target="blank">PathNet: Evolution Channels Gradient Descent in Super Neural Networks</a> and became fascinated on the conceptual simplicity of the underpinning algorithms which build narrow artificial intelligence.

Google's <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">Deep Dream</a>: The best psychedelic visuals ever created. Not by people who have experienced them, who have been emersed within them, who try to decipher them whilst in the midst of a trip - and then attempt to remember the experience afterwards through art, but by code. An algorithm which has never had conscious experiences, either sober or on psychedelics.
