<h3>The painting goblin</h3>

<blockquote>
	<p>"Every time I play the Sims, I start my family with a "painting goblin". I make him/her morbidly obese with green skin. I make sure to give him the following traits: Likes to be alone. Likes art. Hates the outdoors.</p>

	<p>The first thing I do once I have enough money is build a small room in the basement, send him down there, and then remove the stairs. I set him up in a tiny little area with only an easel, a toilet, a refrigerator, a bed, a shower, and a trash bin. All he does all day is paint. That's it. He paints and paints and paints. Eventually his paintings become very good and worth a lot of money. Every few minutes I go downstairs and sell whatever painting he has finished, and then I return to playing the game.</p>

	<p>My family always ends up feeling blessed because of their fortune, and they never find out about the horrible secret living beneath their home"</p>
