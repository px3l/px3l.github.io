<p>Open source code is one of the most important phenomenons in computing. It is societies intrinsic link to economy, the very human desire for IP recognition and a general inherent distrust in the outcomes of sharing that have brought the concept of proprietary, closed source code as the current de-facto. However, I believe just as computing has helped people gain understanding in almost every aspect of the universe, the idea of 'open source' is a vital tool to opening up society from a culture of ownership and control into a culture of sharing.</p>

							<p>The arguments for and against open source are, bizarrely, often coming from the same place: a general distrust in other humans. In brief, arguments against open source often revolve around needing to keep control of code for business reasons or to ensure code security and robustness. Arguments for are open source usually because it is a vital part in technological progression, <a href="http://kubernetes.io/" target="blank">Google's Kubernetes for example</a>, or to ensure code security or robustness.</p>

							<p>I see just one major question we need to ask before all others:</p>
							
							<p>HOW ARE USERS EXPECTED TO TRUST IN SOFTWARE IF THEY ARE TOLD THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE INSIDE IT?</p>
							
							<p>To start with a comparison; We are going through <a href="http://www.labellingmatters.org/latest-news/groundbreaking-study-shows-that-consumers-want-to-know-how-their-food-is-produced.html" target="blank">a similar shift with the food industry.</a> Food origin is again something we are told to believe is the truth, factory packaged with false, misleading images of animals grazing in fields, or text such as 'Farm fresh'. The reality is totally different. Gradually the public is demanding better scrutiny of this and I feel this is the same with code.</p>

							<p>Take a particularly important example; the web-browser extension. This is arguably <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/pubs/heule:2015:the-most.pdf" target="blank">the most dangerous code in the browser</a> (for user privacy) as it is third-party code, the same as web applications, yet runs with elevated privileges which the user usually has to grant. Extensions are particularly bad psychologically, as users believe them to be more trusted than say a random program downloaded from the internet or a slightly dubious web page. However this isn't the case.</p>

							<p>When considering the options for ad-blocking extensions, users have a large choice and most opt for <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="blank">Adblock Plus</a> - a closed source app. Heule, et al, state "over 71% of the top-500 Chrome extensions can trivially leak the user's data from any site" and what is to stop Adblock Plus from being part of that percentage? We do not really know.</p>

							<p>We could know if we could see the source code. The fact is we are trusting humans we have never met to provide us with their code and a promise that it does what it says, securely, with no secret, hidden, or extra functionality.</p>

							<p>One alternative for Adblock Plus is <a href="https://www.ublock.org/" target="blank">uBlock</a>, and this extension is <a href="https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/ublock" target="blank">completely open source.</a> As a result we can be sure that there is no hidden tracking or data leaking as we are able to review the entire codebase.</p>

							<p>I believe this is vital for the future of web development, where third party apps are the norm and everyone can develop and share their own web software with ease. I believe the ability to keep secrets allows for bad intentions to develop, and bad abilities to go unnoticed. If source code is open, there is near zero opportunity to sneak in malicious, insecure or badly functioning code as all the code can be reviewed.</p>
