<p>Just under a decade ago I first got into MMA, and specifically the UFC promotion. It started with a friend I met whilst studying Mathematics A-level at college. He was a hobbyist MMA fighter who got me into watching the UFC. We would go round whenever the next UFC event was on, make a big, angry chilli con carne, crack out lots of ale and stay up for hours watching it, making bets on fighters and basically having the craic.</p>

<p>Back then, it was Englishmen Dan Hardy I was always rooting for. 10 years on, after a gap of about 8 years, I have gotten back into it with the rise of UFC superstar, Conor McGregor. I have been following McGregor for a couple years now and his rise to the top has been sensational and an inspiration for me in his work ethic. Anyway, here are the surprising things I have learnt or observed in the time back:</p>

<h3>Why do I love to watch fighting?</h3>

<p>I have never been in a proper fist to fist until someone drops fight. And to be honest, I don't think I would ever want to be. But I am the sort of guy who would probably go and watch the gladatorial arena, if it was still about. I have a fascination with fighting and I think it is important to explore why, just to make sure I'm not a psychopath.</p>

<p>I am generally anti-guns. They are too easy and remove the shooter from what is at play. I am pro hunting, for example, and I can see the moral argument for a quicker more humane death, but still I would rather to be expert in bow hunting or and mele hunting. Regardless, I would much rather live in a society with strict gun control, much like Japan. And also like Japan, I do not believe that police should be carrying guns. Moreso, martials of the people should be learned in martial arts. It should be skill and strength and creativity that beats criminals, not quicker shooting and better guns. Obviously, this only works if there serious gun control... as it doesn't matter how hard and accurate your roundhouse is, an AK47 is deadlier. Fundamentally, I believe martial arts help you to be mindful and guns lead to being mindless.</p>

<p>The game of fighting is essentially a game to see who can cause a overwhelming surge of neurons firing all at once in your opponents head first. This is a KO. The fighter is knocked out when you cause enough rapid rotational trauma to the head that the brain fires a huge number of neurons at once which effectively puts the brain into standby to avoid more serious damage being done. This can happen with a single hit (usually to the chin or jaw - what fighters refer to as "the button") or through sustained hits which slowly fill up the amount of damage the brain perceives as 'ok', until it is time to turn off. You can think of the head as an xBox and the brain as the circuitry within. If you jolt the xBox whilst it's on, it will likely crash or lag. And most would consider it safer to drop an xBox which is turned off, compared to one which is running. The brain is sophisticated enough to power down when it thinks it will be dropped.</p>

<p>Obviously there are other submissions: threatening a bone breakage, cutting off blood supply through a choke, or what have you, but most generally consider a KO to be the ultimate method of defeat, moreso than a TKO (tapped knock out) or judges decision. I find that no other sport offers a platform to really test every aspect of the human body. It is about endurance and sprint, dexterity and strength, balance and movement, grace and aggression. It is the yin and the yang. It even involves teamwork, though that is maybe not what is presented most at the fights. Once you learn the techniques, the background, the cultures and the reasons. Once you can see what makes a good fighter and what causes fighters to lose (and I am by no means an expert), I cannot see why one wouldn't enjoy to watch.</p>

<h3>UFC as a business</h3>

<p>The UFC business is fascinating. Unlike other major American sporting leagues the UFC deals with single characters. So whereas you might have a football match draw in hundreds of ticket sales of which the club gets a portion, of which the players get a portion, the UFC is totally different.</p>

<p>Firstly the UFC operate a pay-per-view business model. So fans will pay to view the event on TV alongside the always sold out arena ticket sales. It is typically $60 for a fight night and with the UFC superstars, Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey, the total revenue drew in for 2015 was floating about $600,000,000.00 with about 25% of that profit. The money that Conor McGregor will take for one fight will be on top of that and reports are it is regularly above $20 million per fight. On top of that he will receive money from PPVs and sponsorship deals. So it's a serious game indeed.</p>

<p>As well as this I became fascinated with the UFC president, Dana White, who recently sold the UFC to a consortium for a rumoured $4 billion and he retains a 9% profit share! Dana White is one of two prominent figures in the UFC, the other, and my favourite, being Joe Rogan.</p>

<h3>Joe Rogan</h3>

<p>Joe Rogan is the commentator for UFC. I had previously never heard of him, but have since found his podcast and radio show. He is a very interesting guy, very intelligent and critical with some surprising leftist/liberal views. His apparent clarity and interest on the state of the world seems unusual to me for someone so involved in a fighting sport. Certainly his skeptical, inquisitive nature and openness to ideas is refreshing and makes for some killer procrastination time. Below are some of my choice conversations. I'm not saying I agree with the guests opinions by any means, just the conversations are entertaining and insightful.</p>

<h3>Conor McGregor</h3>

<p>McGregor is the most driven person I have ever known of. I have seen every available fight and interview, documentary and video clip and there is not a single instance where he his vision is clouded. He stated in an interview that he believes the key to real success is to have structure in your life. He plans his activities, meals, states of consciousness and relationships meticulously. He is also the only fighter currently, that I have observed, who really calculates his movements. You can see he is a true scientist in his skill and an artist in his creativity. I have watched the two fights (UFC 196 and 202) with Nate Diaz many times. Diaz is another amazing fighter, but he relies on serious strength, an unbelievable chin and relentless energy. Of course he is a brilliant fighter, accurate, knowledgable etc, but he doesn't appear to have constant crtitical thinking of the situation like McGregor. The way that McGregor speaks at press conferences, in interviews, etc, also suggest he is a clever guy and he has an Irish spirit which I am slowly coming to see is born deep in most Irish people.</p>

<h3>Americans are ALL foreign</h3>

<p>I have realised that every American surname is "foreign". As I watch any fight, I find myself always betting against American fighters (sorry - it's only because the UFC is American and I always want the underdog) and would always try and pick who I wanted to win as soon as the fighters name was announced. Every time, the most obscure non-british sounding surnames come up and I am always suprised when they turn out to be born and bred American. Then it dawned on me: Of course they're American. There is no such thing as a culturally ancestral name from Westernised America. The whole country was taken over from the natives and then consisted entirely of immigrants from all over the world. So all the surnames are by default of wildly different foreign descent.</p>

<p>So anyway, there are some thoughts on why I like the UFC. For all it's traditional cliches and amusing parts (like the ring girls, the incredibly funny voice that the ring leader presents fights with...), it is an interesting practice with deep cultural diversity and interesting characters.</p>
