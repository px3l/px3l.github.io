<p>I recently read an article on <a href="http://tedium.co/2017/02/02/disc-rot-phenomenon/" target="blank">Tedium</a> linked from hacker news about disc rot. It reminded me of two times in my past - the first was after a hard drive I had failed. One day it worked, I put it down for a few months and plugged it back in to find it wouldn't mount. I spent some time on command line trying to force its mount and eventually discovered significant sector errors and a totally corrupt boot manager.</p>

<p>The second was whilst working with a research group based in Netherlands. They specialised in long term storage of architectural 3D point cloud scans for conversion to BIM models. This was probably the first time I truly considered the implications of long term data storage based on evolving file types.</p>

<p>I have then pondered the questions: How can we store data long term? And, the less practical and more philosophical question, should we?</p>
