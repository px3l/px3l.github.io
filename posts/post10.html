<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>When I was a teenager, I rebelled against the mobile phone. I don't know what it was about it but I just didn't want one. Without really thinking too much about it then, I believe I foresaw a future of increasing social connections and as a result, imagined each connection becoming weaker. It may have been a bit of that, but it was definitely a bit of relunctance to being able to be contacted 24/7. I liked the ritualesque process of having to ask my parents to use the house phone, making sure no one was online, and then calling a friend's house phone. We would have a conversation worthy of the time and the next one would take place at least a day later.</p>

<p>Eventually at the age of 16 I finally relented to the mobile when I realised I would be more easily able to talk to this particularly attractive girl I had been interested in in school. The power of girls on my young 16 year old mind was the weakness in my armour!</p>

<p>It was a similar story when Facebook was released to the world. Again I refused to join. Again I foresaw a world of an ever increasing number of weakening relationships. For over a year I point blank ignored Facebook, whilst all my friends raved about it and media around the world predicted its importance. This time I was forced to comply, not by my own failing willpower, but by the university I was attending. They told us we had to use Facebook as our main communication for the design group project.</p> 

<p>So again I yeilded.</p>

<p>Then began 8 years of observation and psycho-analysis. In that time I saw myself fall ill of the phenomenom FOMO: the fear of missing out. I saw my good friends disappear into the background, kept afloat in my mind by simple meaningless chats that mostly consisted of:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey. How are you? <br/> Yeah not so bad, you? <br/> Not bad either. Hanging from last night.. <br/> Oh yeah? <br/> Yeah was out til like 5am. <br/> Lol, shite. <br/> Yeah.. Sound well I've got to go so chat soon. <br/> Safe xx</p></blockquote>

<p>A conversation like that and the social itch was scratched enough til the next one. I saw huge swathes of people live a totally different life online to the personality I thought they were. I saw trends start and end over social media. The whole time I observed myself: I kept a check on the effect it had on my mind and my personality, the effect it had on my mood, my friendships and my family. Finally I gave it up. It took two goes to quit. This post is about the research I've found and experiences I have had. In conclusion it led me to start developing an app to help rebuild meaningful relationships which will be described at the end.</p>

<p>I hope this post provides insight to the effect digitalisation has had on society, from my personal perspective.</p>

<h3>Addiction and The Fear Of Missing Out</h3>

<p>Something that became obvious to me, long after it had begun, was the phenomenom of the Fear of Missing Out. Facebook was certainly addictive to me. It is now <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2010.0377?journalCode=cyber" target="blank">undeniable that it is addictive</a>, and possibly even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/02/03/facebook-more-addictive-than-cigarettes-study-says/#71fafedf2782" target="blank">more so than cigarettes</a> claims one of tens of studies undertaken. That addiction manifests in the chemical release from notifications and what is essentially a love and desire to be popular and in the know. I myself was pretty good at Facebook, I kept my posting active, uploaded links and files that I knew would get the respect, and more importantly likes, of my Facebook friends. This builds and builds. Your stats build and build. It is the same effect that gamification has on productivity, simple reward scenarios which help build a digital persona, which may or may not be who you are in real life and often becomes much more important than your physical self and wellbeing.</p>

<p>FoMO is dangerous. Be it from the time spent <a href="https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/news/news-release-archive/articles/new-study-finds-teens-fear-of-missing-out-is-proving-to-be-dangerous" target="blank">driving a car</a>, or just the effects on real relationships. It made me depressed if I had been away with someone and got back to look through the history of my Facebook feed to see what had happened without me. Seeing it unfold without me in real time updates on my feed was even worse! I would often subconciously sacrifice being in the here and now to be depressed about where i wasn't and when.</p>
