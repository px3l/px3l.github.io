<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>When I was a teenager, I rebelled against the mobile phone. I don't know what it was about it but I just didn't want one. Without really thinking too much about it then, I believe I foresaw a future of increasing social connections and as a result, imagined each connection becoming weaker. It may have been a bit of that, but it was definitely a bit of relunctance to being able to be contacted 24/7. I liked the ritualesque process of having to ask my parents to use the house phone, making sure no one was online, and then calling a friend's house phone. We would have a conversation worthy of the time and the next one would take place at least a day later.</p>

<p>Eventually at the age of 16 I finally relented to the mobile when I realised I would be more easily able to talk to this particularly attractive girl I had been interested in in school. The power of girls on my young 16 year old mind was the weakness in my armour!</p>

<p>It was a similar story when Facebook was released to the world. Again I refused to join. Again I foresaw a world of an ever increasing number of weakening relationships. For over a year I point blank ignored Facebook, whilst all my friends raved about it and media around the world predicted its importance. This time I was forced to comply, not by my own failing willpower, but by the university I was attending. They told us we had to use Facebook as our main communication for the design group project.</p> 

<p>So again I yeilded.</p>

<p>Then began 8 years of observation and psycho-analysis. In that time I saw myself fall ill of the phenomenom FOMO: the fear of missing out. I saw my good friends disappear into the background, kept afloat in my mind by simple meaningless chats that mostly consisted of:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey. How are you? <br/> Yeah not so bad, you? <br/> Not bad either. Hanging from last night.. <br/> Oh yeah? <br/> Yeah was out til like 5am. <br/> Lol, shite. <br/> Yeah.. Sound well I've got to go so chat soon. <br/> Safe xx</p></blockquote>

<p>A conversation like that and the social itch was scratched enough til the next one. I saw huge swathes of people live a totally different life online to the personality I thought they were. I saw trends start and end over social media. The whole time I observed myself: I kept a check on the effect it had on my mind and my personality, the effect it had on my mood, my friendships and my family. Finally I gave it up. It took two goes to quit. This post is about the research I've found and experiences I have had. In conclusion it led me to start developing an app to help rebuild meaningful relationships which will be described at the end.</p>

<p>I hope this post provides insight to the effect digitalisation has had on society, from my personal perspective.</p>
