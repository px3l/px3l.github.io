<p>Many people do not even consider that what we know as time is made up. It is an invention, albeit one which has gone through lengthy development. It is an invention which has significantly helped globalisation and the development of a species in harmony with itself, no matter of geography. However, on the reverse side, is it removing our relationship with the natural systems of the universe? We have abstracted ourselves out of nature in a very fundamental way. One so subtle, it is difficult to properly grasp on a visceral level.</p>

							<p>Time as we know it today had its last major update because of the railways. Through them, we had developed a method to travel across the world at a speed most unnatural to us. The population travelled further, faster and became out of sync, unharmonized and needed a way to keep everyone working together. This was the development of a standard global "time". Time 2.0.0.</p>

							<p>The reality is there is no such thing as a past. Or a future. We exist at exactly now and only now. We are the present moment of an ongoing process. (Actually we may really be living very slightly in the "past" as it takes time for our bodily impulses to move around and become aware of the present).</p>

							<p>As such we have evolved intrinsically tied to our context. We are adapted to respond to fluctuating seasons and changing climates. What we do by living religiously by our clocks is to reject natural systems. In 2011, Samoa moved itself from one side of the international date line to the other and it lost a whole day in the process. People born on Friday 30th December, 2011, were told to either celebrate their birthdays a day early or late as their birthday no longer exists this year. This statement is of course ridiculous, of course they had a birthday that year, it just wasn't recognised by humans. It may sound fairly trivial and slightly amusing but I think this method of thinking can have profound effects on our mental and physical health as people from the Earth.</p>

							<p>Many countries have rejected the standardising of global time as it breaks their internal time structures up and threatens cultural heritage. There is no doubt that this is a fundamental part of a globalised world. I think it is an oversimplification of a very chaotic natural process that if we ignore we may lose our sense of self as a species of life alongside the other 8.7 billion.</p>

							<p>Technology and progression is amazing, the scientific method and discovery is amazing, our ability to measure and describe is amazing, but I feel we should not live by our descriptions, but by our reality. For science, research and discovery, yes of course these actions are vital, but I think as individuals we should stop counting, and categorising and measuring our lives and enjoy the process as best we can and try as best we can to make it better for the parts of the process in the future that we will never see. </p>
