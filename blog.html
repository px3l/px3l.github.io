							<p>I was employed as a manager for a small high street PC shop. I have worked in a PC shop previously, when I was 13 to 16 or so, basically doing the same sort of stuff: fixing computers, building computers, sourcing components and dealing with customers. Now, a decade on, it is interesting to see how the PC shop has evolved (or not) and explore its place in the current market. Besides the shift from desktops through laptops to mobile devices, there has been one other very significant change - almost the entire population now uses the internet as their first stop for any PC related business. And with the internet's exponential popularity, far greater individual thirst for collaboration and community. It appears a serious shift in what a high street PC shop offers is needed...</p>

							<p>See below for the shops website and the blog, which I will be working on in tandem with this personal one.</p>

Here is a collection from the many oases of delight in the ever growing network. Ordered roughly in some sense from the significance of life on Earth to the insignificance of our scale. Enjoy...</p>

							<p>Many people do not even consider that what we know as time is made up. It is an invention, albeit one which has gone through lengthy development. It is an invention which has significantly helped globalisation and the development of a species in harmony with itself, no matter of geography. However, on the reverse side, is it removing our relationship with the natural systems of the universe? We have abstracted ourselves out of nature in a very fundamental way. One so subtle, it is difficult to properly grasp on a visceral level.</p>

							<p>Time as we know it today had its last major update because of the railways. Through them, we had developed a method to travel across the world at a speed most unnatural to us. The population travelled further, faster and became out of sync, unharmonized and needed a way to keep everyone working together. This was the development of a standard global "time". Time 2.0.0.</p>

							<p>The reality is there is no such thing as a past. Or a future. We exist at exactly now and only now. We are the present moment of an ongoing process. (Actually we may really be living very slightly in the "past" as it takes time for our bodily impulses to move around and become aware of the present).</p>

							<p>As such we have evolved intrinsically tied to our context. We are adapted to respond to fluctuating seasons and changing climates. What we do by living religiously by our clocks is to reject natural systems. In 2011, Samoa moved itself from one side of the international date line to the other and it lost a whole day in the process. People born on Friday 30th December, 2011, were told to either celebrate their birthdays a day early or late as their birthday no longer exists this year. This statement is of course ridiculous, of course they had a birthday that year, it just wasn't recognised by humans. It may sound fairly trivial and slightly amusing but I think this method of thinking can have profound effects on our mental and physical health as people from the Earth.</p>

							<p>Many countries have rejected the standardising of global time as it breaks their internal time structures up and threatens cultural heritage. There is no doubt that this is a fundamental part of a globalised world. I think it is an oversimplification of a very chaotic natural process that if we ignore we may lose our sense of self as a species of life alongside the other 8.7 billion.</p>

							<p>Technology and progression is amazing, the scientific method and discovery is amazing, our ability to measure and describe is amazing, but I feel we should not live by our descriptions, but by our reality. For science, research and discovery, yes of course these actions are vital, but I think as individuals we should stop counting, and categorising and measuring our lives and enjoy the process as best we can and try as best we can to make it better for the parts of the process in the future that we will never see. </p>

							<p>A new type of architect is coming. One with greater vision, greater influence and greater understanding. This architect of the future understands the building she/he/they will design not only from the material to the philosophy in the traditional sense, but from the electron in the wiring to the connectivity of the internet and the languages to converse these layers as part of a new, technological world.</p>

							<p>We have seen a transition from top of the pyramid "architect" to a more inclusive "archtect-planner", a move which requires a greater level of understanding laterally: in a buildings context. And, we are in that same evolution in the software version of the architect too.</p>

							<h3>What is “Full Stack”?</h3>

							<p>In the world of computer science, and specifically web program development, there is a debate currently engaging the community. It began with the converging of ‘devs’ (developers): people writing programs, and ‘ops’ (operations): people who focus on how those programs run.</p>

							<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="blank">‘Dev-ops’</a> is a world where you have not just the code to worry about, but also how it runs at scale across the globe, when hundreds, or even millions of users are trying to use applications and manipulate data without errors or downtime.</p>

							<h3>The Stack</h3>

							<p>The ‘stack’ is essentially the layers of knowledge needed to create these very smooth running web applications. It starts at the top, with the front-end. This is the end you see when you go onto the web browser and use the mouse/keyboard/touch device to manipulate that view. This is written in one language.</p>

							<p>Go down a layer and we get to the server side code, often written in a different framework or language, powering the calculations from the front-end events. Down a layer again and we have the data-stores. Down again we have the Operating System, the kernel layer.</p>

							<p>Common ‘full stacks’ are the <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/LAMP.html" target="blank">LAMP</a> stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), and a more modern <a href="http://mean.io/" target="blank">MEAN</a> stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, NodeJS), usually running on Linux as well.</p>

							<p>Now, this is where most developers say the stack ends, but this is where the debate begins and <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-4e3fb9c25867#.gdpddiiyd" target="blank">there are many more layers beyond this scope.</a></p>

							<p>Below the OS we find the Hypervisor; VMs. Then we have the BIOS and finally the physical hardware of the computer. Then we get into the operations end of things.</p>

							<h3>The Internet</h3>

							<p>From the application layer, software and the current ‘full stack’, we can go down the internet route. First, underneath the software application we find the TCP layer, otherwise known as the Transport Layer. Then we find the IP layer, which handles the addresses and routing. Then we find the Network Access Layer which handles the ethernet/wifi/etc protocols. Finally we have the hardware layer again, the same hardware as found in most computers, but also radiowaves, copper and fibre.</p>

							<p>Arguably, it is necessary to have a level of knowledge in every single one of these layers, in order to design and build the best applications for the internet. This is the current debate in the computer science community. We know it starts at the human interaction with the web browser, the UX, but where does the stack end? How much is necessary to know?</p>

							<h3>The Built Environment</h3>

							<p>Now as computing becomes ubiquitous in our built world through the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), operations and facilities management, the stack can theoretically continue through the physical computer and into the building fabric itself, through the software application to the construction data.</p>

							<p>If applications are to handle the design, construction and operations of the building, and hardware is embedded in its fabric, a knowledge of how they work with the building is vital.</p>

							<h3>One size does not fit all</h3>

							<p>Existing BIM solutions are barely built for the internet, but with <a href="https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/bim-levels-explained" target="blank">BIM level 3</a> currently being defined as the connected BIM, it is becoming more apparent that without a network this is impossible. Current software vendors design large monolithic code bases with steep learning curves and there are only a few authoring programs to pick from. With such monopoly over the computer side of AEC, and all the effort put into extending these large programs, creating lightweight bespoke buildings becomes more and more difficult.</p>

							<p>Architect designers, who are dreaming up the look, feel and function of the building should also be thinking of the applications required to design, and operate it. Applications which become part of the building, passed on from stage to stage: from contractors to clients, from builders to users.</p>

							<p>The only way to deliver this effectively is through the internet. So where do the architects and engineers of the future need to draw the line on their knowledge? It is certainly well beyond where the line currently lies, where they can often just about use a user friendly program, let alone know how programs work on a code level. However, alongside computer science they also need to retain their knowledge of materiality, physics, and theory from the built world.</p>

							<p>This is a lot to ask for any single human, and it is the team expertise that will prove most useful here, but without the awareness or knowledge of the stack to a degree, perfectly performing buildings in the future are out of reach.</p>

							<blockquote>

							<p>Open source code is one of the most important phenomenons in computing. It is societies intrinsic link to economy, the very human desire for IP recognition and a general inherent distrust in the outcomes of sharing that have brought the concept of proprietary, closed source code as the current de-facto. However, I believe just as computing has helped people gain understanding in almost every aspect of the universe, the idea of 'open source' is a vital tool to opening up society from a culture of ownership and control into a culture of sharing.</p>

							<p>The arguments for and against open source are, bizarrely, often coming from the same place: a general distrust in other humans. In brief, arguments against open source often revolve around needing to keep control of code for business reasons or to ensure code security and robustness. Arguments for are open source usually because it is a vital part in technological progression, <a href="http://kubernetes.io/" target="blank">Google's Kubernetes for example</a>, or to ensure code security or robustness.</p>

							<p>I see just one major question we need to ask before all others:</p>
							
							<p>HOW ARE USERS EXPECTED TO TRUST IN SOFTWARE IF THEY ARE TOLD THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE INSIDE IT?</p>
							
							<p>To start with a comparison; We are going through <a href="http://www.labellingmatters.org/latest-news/groundbreaking-study-shows-that-consumers-want-to-know-how-their-food-is-produced.html" target="blank">a similar shift with the food industry.</a> Food origin is again something we are told to believe is the truth, factory packaged with false, misleading images of animals grazing in fields, or text such as 'Farm fresh'. The reality is totally different. Gradually the public is demanding better scrutiny of this and I feel this is the same with code.</p>

							<p>Take a particularly important example; the web-browser extension. This is arguably <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/pubs/heule:2015:the-most.pdf" target="blank">the most dangerous code in the browser</a> (for user privacy) as it is third-party code, the same as web applications, yet runs with elevated privileges which the user usually has to grant. Extensions are particularly bad psychologically, as users believe them to be more trusted than say a random program downloaded from the internet or a slightly dubious web page. However this isn't the case.</p>

							<p>When considering the options for ad-blocking extensions, users have a large choice and most opt for <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="blank">Adblock Plus</a> - a closed source app. Heule, et al, state "over 71% of the top-500 Chrome extensions can trivially leak the user's data from any site" and what is to stop Adblock Plus from being part of that percentage? We do not really know.</p>

							<p>We could know if we could see the source code. The fact is we are trusting humans we have never met to provide us with their code and a promise that it does what it says, securely, with no secret, hidden, or extra functionality.</p>

							<p>One alternative for Adblock Plus is <a href="https://www.ublock.org/" target="blank">uBlock</a>, and this extension is <a href="https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/ublock" target="blank">completely open source.</a> As a result we can be sure that there is no hidden tracking or data leaking as we are able to review the entire codebase.</p>

							<p>I believe this is vital for the future of web development, where third party apps are the norm and everyone can develop and share their own web software with ease. I believe the ability to keep secrets allows for bad intentions to develop, and bad abilities to go unnoticed. If source code is open, there is near zero opportunity to sneak in malicious, insecure or badly functioning code as all the code can be reviewed.</p>
